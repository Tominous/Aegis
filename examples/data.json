This is an example of an Aegis data file. This is responsible for storing backup information.

{
    "backups": [ (list of JSON, storing all current backups within the server storage system. organized by server UUID)
        {
            "xHfa8": [
                {
                    "date": 1489696372, (int of UNIX timestamp when backup was made)
                    "size": 43200, (int of backup size in MB)
                    "checksum": TBD, (md5 is expensive to compute, but i will figure out a way of very quickly hashing the tar.gz file for data integrity check)
                },
                { (another backup)
                    "date": 1489696500, (int of UNIX timestamp when backup was made)
                    "size": 43223, (int of backup size in MB)
                    "checksum": TBD, (md5 is expensive to compute, but i will figure out a way of very quickly hashing the tar.gz file for data integrity check)
                },

            ],
        }
